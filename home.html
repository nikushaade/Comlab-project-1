  <h2> THE STORY</h2>

  <p>The idea of the movie was first born on a rainy day in Abu Dhabi, when all hell broke loose, and I heard my neighbors intensely fighting in Arabic. Through my minimal understanding of the language, I came to realization that the husband of the family was actually living a double life. He had two families, one in Abu Dhabi and the other one in Caracas, Venezuela. It all sounded like a Latin American soap opera, but it had a twist to it – a twist that later translated into our movie. </p>

<p>In that exact moment I got an artistic and directorial inspiration and called my team at GoodHuman Productions. I called for an emergency meeting and after a 3-hour discussion, brainstorming and endless arguments the “Once Upon A Time in The Land of Latin Arabia” was born. We had discovered that there were many similarities between the Latin American soap operas and Arab movies, something that was never discovered or observed before. GoodHuman Productions prides itself on innovation and the moment we started filming the movie, we knew that the nomination for “30 Minute Film Festival” was not far away. On January 31st, our production team was informed of the nomination and after the reviews came in, we knew that we had discovered a completely new movie industry with a very large customer base. </p>


<p>When we sat down to discuss the next steps for the production, we came to realization that our team was not in this for the profits, but rather to enrich the experience of movie lovers and unite the fans of classical soap operas with fans of dramatic movies. When I called my mentor and long-time friend, Martin Scorsese, he told me that “Latin Arabia” may completely shift the movie and show-business industry to a new era.  We, here at GoodHuman Productions, pride ourselves with our projects and we strive to be the game-changers in the increasingly competitive movie industry. </p>

<p>Before the release of the movie on February 19th, we decided that profits and money aren’t our top priority, but rather evolution of the movie industry. Thus, we have decided to make the movie available for free on our website, so that no one is constrained from watching it. Enjoy the movie and await for more from GoodHuman Productions.</p>

	<div class = "content" id = "nik"> Nik is the creative director of the team, as well as producer and actor. The inspiration of the movie came to him, while being in his room and after intense discussions with his teammates, they came up with "Once Upon a Time in Latin Arabia. Nikoloz has been nominated for Oscars 46 times and still holds the record for most wins by an actor and by a director - a combined 46 wins. His directorial debut came in 2004, when he was 7, in the role of assistant director to Tim Van Paten on 4 seasons of Sopranos. His first Oscar nomination came at the age of 10 when he produced "The Departed". He has also won Oscar nominations in "Best Actor", "Best Supporting Actor", "Best Directorial Debut", "Best Foreign Film" and many more. To this day Nikoloz stays a very important and integral part of GoodHuman Productions and with the success of "Once Upon a Time in Latin Arabia", we are hoping for a longer and even more fruitful partnership.</div>
	<div class = "content" id = "lusine"> Lusine is the screenwriter and assistant director of the movie. She started her career in Armenia, producing instant classics such as "Ararat", "Yeva, "Mayrig" and “Giqor”. At the age of 18 she moved to Abu Dhabi, where her career took off. After joining GoodHuman Productions, Lusine has been Nominated for Oscars 22 times, majority of them coming in form of "Best Screenplay". She won the Oscars 21 times, handing over the 22nd win to up-and-coming Armenian actress and director Araz Aslanian (A well deserved win and a public mistake by the Academy). Nowadays, apart from "Once Upon a Time in Latin Arabia", Lusine is working on many projects involving her homecountry Armenia. She just wrapped up filming in Yerevan for an upcoming Armenian love story, produced and directed by her in collaboration with GoodHuman Productions. When asked about the "Latin Arabia", Lusine stated that this was "her best work to date". GoodHumans Productions is grateful to have Lusine as part of the team. </div>
	<div class = "content" id = "anita"> Anita is the bright star of GoodHuman Productions. She has been an actor for the past decade, making her debut at the age of 12. She has starred in many Czech classics such as "Kolya" and "Divided we fall". Once moving to Abu Dhabi in 2015, she joined the GoodHuman Productions and her career took off. Ever since 2015, she has been nominated for 4 "Best Actress" performance and 4 "Best supporting Actress performance" all in the same years. Anita currently is working on a new movie with Leonardo Dicaprio, Brad Pitt and Jack Nicholson, which is produced by Nikoloz Adeishvili and GoodHuman Productions. Anita stars as a hitman for the Yakuza and the movie has been heavily anticipated by the public. Anita is not only a great actress, but also an amazing philantropist and social activist. She has been very prominent in Czech politics and currently leads the "National Democratic Party of Czech Republic". GoodHuman Productions and Anita Duskova are working on a contract extension, that will hopefully yield many more interesting movies and TV series.</div>
